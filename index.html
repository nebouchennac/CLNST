          <div class="section-title">
          <p>
                 Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is an evidence-based approach to creating meaningful or socially significant behavior change. New skills and behaviors are taught
                 while existing behaviors are modified. ABA focuses on behaviors that are observable and measurable, with respect to their function. This is determined through the
                 collection of data that involves antecedents and consequences, which are events that occur directly before and after the behavior of interest. This approach utilizes
                 principles of reinforcement, to increase skills that are functional and socially significant throughout the child’s daily life. ABA not only teaches these skills, but
                 also promotes maintenance and generalization of the skills. ABA also serves to decrease behaviors that may interfere with learning, such as tantrums, aggression, or
                 stereotypy. Treatment plans are developed to facilitate learning based on the individualized need of each child. Areas that we work on include (but are not limited to):

           <div class="section-title">
          <p>
                Floor-time, also known as Developmental, Individual-differences, Relationship-based (DIR) Floor-time, is an
intervention that focuses on promoting emotional and intellectual growth in children with developmental and learning
challenges. It is a play-based therapy that aims to help children develop the foundational capacities for relating,
communicating, and thinking. Floor-time encourages parents and caregivers to engage with the child in a way that
follows the child's lead and interests, promoting emotional connections and social interactions. The therapy is
designed to help children progress through the developmental stages at their own pace, building on their strengths
and addressing their individual challenges.

          <p>
              Our center-based program focuses on teaching basic skills to enhance learning for each child. Each child
participates in a session with a Program therapist or therapist technician, with individual programming created by the
Director. In addition to traditional therapy methods, our naturopathic services are integrated to support the overall
well-being and health of the children.

              To ensure that all skills are generalized, and that parents and family members can successfully implement the plan
at home, our home-based services include training parents or caregivers to take on the role of the therapist under
our supervision. This approach allows for the integration of naturopathic principles and techniques into the home
environment, providing a holistic and consistent support system for the child's development. Our naturopathic
approach is incorporated into the training process, emphasizing the importance of natural and holistic methods in
the home-based therapy program. We recognize the significance of involving parents or caregivers in the therapy
process and aim to provide comprehensive support and guidance to ensure the success of the program in natural
environments, especially in the home and community settings.

of parents in the therapy process is crucial for the lasting effects of the program. In addition to traditional parent
training, our naturopathic education and training will be available to provide holistic support and guidance for
